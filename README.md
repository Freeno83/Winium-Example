# Winium-Example
Python example of how to use Winium to automate windows programs

In this document, the use of the python library named “Winium” is discussed with an example of how it was used.  
The use case is very specific so the intent of the document is not to provide code or a tool that can be used as is, 
but rather to provide an example to help understand how to use the Winium Library.

The Winium library is a tool to help automate operation of Windows based programs, 
or to move things automatically, by “the hand of god” so to speak.  
In this case, it is a central processing unit doing the movement, not Diego Maradona.
